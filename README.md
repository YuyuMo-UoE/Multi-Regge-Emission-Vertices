# Multi-Regge-Emission-Vertices library
This includes an transition code from amplitudes in GGT package to minimal set of lightcone variable, and also extraction from amplitude to CEV and PEV. It includes all results for colour ordered PEVs and CEVs from one to 4 emissions.

# Usage
Put "Example_v0" in the **same** extraction directory. So that it can read all the data file ".m". Open it and enjoy.
